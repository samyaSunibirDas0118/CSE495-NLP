In this paper, we explore the concept of cap-
turing semantic similarities from word vectors
obtained from monolingual corpora using a
three-step method. Instead of training Bangla
and English word embeddings in a single vec-
tor space in a Cross-lingual manner, we sep-
arately train Bangla word embeddings using
the largest Bangla newspaper dataset and uti-
lize the pre-trained Word2vec model trained
on Google News Corpus for English word em-
beddings. Our three-step approach demon-
strated we could extract the deeper semantic
relationship between word pairs by comparing
them directly and exploring their neighbouring
words.
